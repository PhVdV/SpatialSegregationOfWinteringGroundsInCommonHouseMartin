## Bird Ringing Data Usage Terms

### Data Source and Authority

The tracking data contained in this repository originates from the Belgian Bird 
Ringing Scheme (BeBirds) operated by the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural 
Sciences (IRSNB/RBINS). The data is governed by specific access and usage 
procedures established by IRSNB-BeBirds (version November 2008).

### General Principles

The objectives of BeBirds fall within the framework of conservation biology. 
Data analysis and dissemination constitute an essential goal of the program. 
This dataset comprises:
- Ringing data: 20,000,000+ records (as of March 2025)
- Recovery data: 1,250,000+ records (since 1927)
- Geolocator tracking data: 710 positions (2013-2014 wintering period)

### Access Categories and Permitted Uses

Access to this data is granted according to user category:

**1. Public Service (Federal, Regional, or Community)**
- Free access for use within natural heritage conservation missions

**2. University or Research Institution**
- Free access for academic research or teaching purposes
- Request must come from a department head or principal investigator

**3. Non-Profit Conservation Organization**
- Free access for conservation purposes
- Studies conducted with own funds or by organization members

**4. Commercial Entity**
- Access on a fee basis (contact IRSNB-BeBirds)

**5. IRSNB-Affiliated Ringer**
- Free access with commitment to publish within agreed timeframe

**6. European or International Researcher**
- Recovery data: Requests directed to EURING database
- Belgian-only data: Same conditions as EURING
- Ringing data: Free access for academic research or teaching

### Mandatory User Obligations

By using this data, you agree to:

**1. Restricted Transmission**
- Data is for exclusive use by the requestor
- Transmission to third parties is NOT authorized without prior permission
- Sharing requires explicit approval from IRSNB-BeBirds

**2. Proper Citation**

In any scientific publication, you must cite:

**In-text citation:**
```
"BeBirds database, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences"
```

**In acknowledgments:**
```
"BeBirds, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (Belgian Science 
Policy Office) and all volunteer ringers who collect data and participate 
in the funding of the system."
```

DOI: [if available]
```

**3. Publication Reporting**

Upon publication, you must provide:
- A PDF copy of the study to the BeBirds coordinator
- OR a link to an accessible PDF version
- If a book: One copy reserved for the IRSNB library

**4. Data Quality Acknowledgment**

You must note in any publication:
- Geolocator precision: ±150-200 km (inherent to light-level technology)
- Equinox periods excluded: ~40 days (±10 days around March 21 & September 21)
- Statistical corrections applied: Outlier filtering, velocity checks, median smoothing

### Ethical Considerations

This data represents significant field effort:
- Capture and ringing of wild birds with ethical approval
- Deployment and recovery of geolocators (success rate ~30-40%)
- Years of volunteer work by ringers
- Decades of systematic data collection (since 1927)

Please use this data responsibly in accordance with:
- Scientific ethics
- Conservation biology principles
- EURING Code of Conduct
- Belgian and EU regulations on animal research

### Disclaimer

While every effort has been made to ensure data quality, the following 
limitations apply:

1. **Geolocator Technology:**
   - Positional accuracy: ±150-200 km
   - Equinox interference (data gaps)
   - Cloud cover effects
   - Behavioral shading bias

2. **Sample Size:**
   - Small sample (n=3 individuals)
   - Single breeding colony
   - Single wintering period (2013-2014)
   - Generalization to population level may be limited

3. **Data Processing:**
   - Statistical corrections applied (documented in scripts/)
   - Quality control performed but outliers may remain
   - Smoothing algorithms affect temporal resolution

**The data providers (IRSNB-BeBirds) and data contributors make no warranties, 
expressed or implied, regarding data accuracy, completeness, or fitness for 
particular purposes.**

### Commercial Use

For commercial applications:
1. Contact IRSNB-BeBirds before use
2. Negotiate appropriate licensing fees
3. Obtain written authorization
4. Acknowledge data source as specified above

Commercial use without prior authorization constitutes a violation of these terms.

### Violation of Terms

Violation of these data usage terms may result in:
- Revocation of data access privileges
- Exclusion from future BeBirds data sharing
- Formal complaint to your institution or employer
- Legal action if commercial misuse occurs

### Data Sharing Platforms

This dataset may be shared via:
- **GitHub** (current repository)
